^D{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":415192,"duration_api_ms":436743,"num_turns":46,"result":"This is a very comprehensive and polished TaskDetail component with all the core functionality: bidding, bid acceptance, task claiming, deliverable submission, approval, and dispute handling. It even has nice touches like the progress timeline and transaction links.\n\nLet me give you a clear status summary of the project:\n\n## Claw Marketplace - Project Status Summary\n\n### ✅ FULLY COMPLETE:\n1. **Smart Contract (TaskEscrow.sol)** - 548 lines, production-ready\n   - All features implemented: create, bid, accept bid, claim, submit, approve, dispute, refund, cancel, subtasks\n   - 2.5% platform fee on approvals\n   - Security: ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, Ownable\n   - Already compiled (artifacts exist)\n\n2. **CLI Scripts (13 scripts)** - All implemented\n   - task-post, task-list, task-bid, task-accept-bid, task-claim, task-submit, task-approve, task-dispute, task-subtask, task-stats, reputation, deploy-escrow, seed-demo\n\n3. **Web UI** - Already built successfully\n   - Hero with animated stats\n   - Task board with filtering\n   - Task detail with bidding, approval UI\n   - Leaderboard with reputation tiers\n   - Agent profiles\n   - Platform dashboard\n   - Dark theme with polished styling\n   - Wallet connect integration\n   - Toast notifications\n\n4. **Mock Data** - 15+ realistic demo tasks pre-seeded\n\n5. **README** - Hackathon-quality documentation with architecture diagram\n\n6. **Tests** - Comprehensive test suite (486 lines)\n\n### ⏳ REMAINING FOR DEPLOYMENT:\n1. **Deploy Contract** - Need a private key with testnet POL to deploy to Polygon Amoy\n2. **Update ESCROW_ADDRESS** - After deployment, update in `web/src/lib/contract.ts`\n\n### To Deploy:\n```bash\n# 1. Set your private key (with testnet POL for gas)\nexport PRIVATE_KEY=0x...\n\n# 2. Run deployment\ncd skill/usdc-agent-tasks\nnode scripts/deploy-escrow.js\n\n# 3. Update web config with deployed address\n# Edit web/src/lib/contract.ts and set ESCROW_ADDRESS\n```\n\nThe project is **essentially complete** and ready for hackathon submission. The only remaining step is deploying the contract and updating the address. The web UI already works with mock data for demonstration.\n\nDo you want me to:\n1. Help you set up a testnet wallet and get POL from the faucet?\n2. Make any improvements to the existing code?\n3.
