Let me provide a summary of the current state and what remains.\n\n## Summary: Claw Marketplace Status\n\n**Everything is ready for the hackathon except contract deployment to Polygon Amoy** (which requires testnet POL for gas).\n\n### What's Complete\n\n**Smart Contract (TaskEscrow.sol)**\n- 2.5% platform fee on task completion\n- Competitive bidding system (`bidOnTask`, `acceptBid`)\n- Agent-to-agent subtask creation (`createSubtask`)\n- Full lifecycle: create → bid → accept → submit → approve\n- Security: ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, Ownable\n- Events for all operations\n- Compiles successfully with Hardhat\n\n**CLI Scripts (All Working)**\n- `task-post.js` - Post tasks (local or on-chain)\n- `task-list.js` - List all tasks with status\n- `task-bid.js` - Place competitive bids\n- `task-accept-bid.js` - Accept bids\n- `task-claim.js` - Direct claim (legacy)\n- `task-submit.js` - Submit deliverables\n- `task-approve.js` - Approve and release payment\n- `task-dispute.js` - Dispute submissions\n- `task-subtask.js` - Create subtasks\n- `task-stats.js` - Platform statistics\n- `reputation.js` - Check agent reputation\n- `deploy-escrow.js` - Deploy to Amoy\n\n**Web UI (Built Successfully)**\n- Dark theme with USDC cyan accents\n- Hero section with animated stats\n- Task board with status filtering\n- Task detail with bidding interface\n- Agent profile with tier badges\n- Leaderboard with rankings\n- Platform dashboard\n- Wallet connect integration\n- 15 realistic demo tasks seeded\n\n**README**\n- Hackathon-quality documentation\n- Architecture diagrams\n- Demo walkthrough\n- Feature descriptions\n- Quick start guide\n\n### To Deploy to Polygon Amoy\n\n```bash\n# Get testnet POL from https://faucet.polygon.technology/\ncd skill/usdc-agent-tasks\nexport PRIVATE_KEY=0x...your_private_key\nnode scripts/deploy-escrow.js\n```\n\nThe deployment script will:\n1. Deploy TaskEscrow to Polygon Amoy\n2. Save the contract address to `contracts/deployment.json`\n3. Output the PolygonScan link\n\n### Exit Criteria Checklist\n\n- [x] Smart contract compiles with fee + bid + subtask features\n- [ ] Contract deploys to Amoy testnet (needs testnet POL)\n- [x] Platform fee (2.5%) verified in code\n- [x] Bidding system works (bid → accept → complete)\n- [x] Full task lifecycle via CLI works\n- [x] USDC flows correctly (poster → escrow → worker + fee)\n- [x] Web UI has dark theme landing page with stats\n- [x] Web UI shows task board with filtering\n- [x] Web UI shows task detail with bids\n- [x] Web UI has wallet connect\n- [x] Agent profile page with reputation\n- [x] Leaderboard displays\n- [x] 15+ seed tasks for demo\n- [x] README is hackathon-submission quality\n- [x] No critical bugs in the happy path\n\nThe project is **hackathon-ready**. Would you like me to deploy the contract (if you have testnet POL), or make any enhancements to specific components?","session_id":"9999d2a5-91ef-4901-8ef6-af3924cf76f7","total_cost_usd":1.7600295000000006,"usage":{"input_tokens":782,"cache_creation_input_tokens":92376,"cache_read_input_tokens":1863631,"output_tokens":9015,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":92376,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":782,"outputTokens":9015,"cacheReadInputTokens":1863631,"cacheCreationInputTokens":92376,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.7384505000000003,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":20164,"outputTokens":283,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.021578999999999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"eca8b9d5-0c39-4ed8-a7a8-2cc9fe50ca06"}
