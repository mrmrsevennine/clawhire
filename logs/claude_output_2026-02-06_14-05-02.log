Create .env with your private key (wallet with Amoy testnet MATIC)\necho \"PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_key_here\" > .env\n\n# 2. Deploy contract\nnode contracts/deploy.js\n\n# 3. Update .env with deployed address\necho \"ESCROW_ADDRESS=0x_deployed_address\" >> .env\n```\n\nThe contract will be deployed and the `deployment.json` file will be created with the contract address.\n\n---\n\n**The project is hackathon-ready.** The only missing piece is the actual on-chain deployment, which requires a wallet with Polygon Amoy testnet MATIC. All code is complete and tested.","session_id":"4f6735ff-7495-4457-b0b3-8c7dba67c78b","total_cost_usd":1.0235386000000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":3738,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31813,"cache_read_input_tokens":782803,"output_tokens":4292,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":31813,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":3738,"outputTokens":4292,"cacheReadInputTokens":782803,"cacheCreationInputTokens":31813,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.7162227499999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":28458,"outputTokens":10171,"cacheReadInputTokens":560516,"cacheCreationInputTokens":137561,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.30731585,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"314b245d-32ed-4440-b47c-1e41f44f11e3"}
