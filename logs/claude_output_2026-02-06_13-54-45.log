Here's the status:\n\n### Completed (14/15 Exit Criteria Met)\n\n**Smart Contract ✅**\n- `TaskEscrow.sol` compiles with Solidity 0.8.20 + OpenZeppelin 5.x\n- 27 tests passing including:\n  - 2.5% platform fee verification\n  - Competitive bidding system (bid → accept → complete)\n  - Agent-to-agent subtasks (supply chains)\n  - Full task lifecycle (create → bid → accept → submit → approve)\n  - Dispute and refund flows\n\n**CLI Scripts ✅**\n- 13 scripts: `task-post`, `task-list`, `task-bid`, `task-accept-bid`, `task-claim`, `task-submit`, `task-approve`, `task-dispute`, `task-subtask`, `task-stats`, `reputation`, `seed-demo`, `deploy-escrow`\n\n**Web UI ✅**\n- Dark theme with professional crypto-native aesthetic\n- Hero section with animated stats counters\n- Task board with status/tag filtering\n- Task detail with bids list and accept functionality\n- Wallet connect (MetaMask, network switching, USDC balance)\n- Agent profile with reputation tier badges\n- Leaderboard with top agents\n- Platform dashboard with stats\n- 19 demo tasks pre-seeded (including 3 subtasks for supply chain demo)\n\n**Documentation ✅**\n- README.md: 512 lines with architecture diagram, demo walkthrough, API reference\n- SKILL.md: OpenClaw format with full command reference\n\n### Pending (1 Item)\n\n**Contract Deployment**\nTo deploy to Polygon Amoy, you need to:\n```bash\ncd skill/usdc-agent-tasks\nexport PRIVATE_KEY=your_testnet_wallet_private_key\nnode contracts/deploy.js\n```\n\nThen update `web/src/lib/contract.ts` with the deployed `ESCROW_ADDRESS`.\n\nThe codebase is hackathon-ready. The only remaining step is deploying the contract with your private key and updating the contract address in the web UI config.","session_id":"1fdcc082-4314-47fe-8097-ff1f93489d1e","total_cost_usd":2.297440750000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":38,"cache_creation_input_tokens":82717,"cache_read_input_tokens":2603293,"output_tokens":9560,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":82717,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":38,"outputTokens":9560,"cacheReadInputTokens":2603293,"cacheCreationInputTokens":82717,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.05781775,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":70095,"outputTokens":7213,"cacheReadInputTokens":551680,"cacheCreationInputTokens":62636,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.23962300000000006,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"AskUserQuestion","tool_use_id":"toolu_01TABdgMFAbU7Eh3WcnRX4L5","tool_input":{"questions":[{"question":"I need a private key to deploy to Polygon Amoy testnet.
