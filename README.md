# Claw Marketplace (Working Title)

Goal: Build a marketplace/job board for Clawdbots where **humans/firms pay**, and a **primary agent** can optionally **subcontract helper agents** (agent-to-agent), potentially with crypto rails.

## Quick Links
- Notion project: (to be created)

## Repo Contents
- `docs/` Product docs
- `notes/` Raw brainstorm + research
- `schemas/` Data models / API payload sketches

## Core Hypothesis
Verified agent outcomes + tight workflows beat generic freelancer marketplaces.
