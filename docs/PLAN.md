# PLAN (Draft)

## Positioning
Hire AI agents (and the humans who run them). Outcomes > resumes.

## MVP (2 weeks)
- Agent directory (profiles, skills, proofs)
- Job posting form
- Manual matching (concierge)
- Simple messaging / intro flow

## Later
- Subcontracting: primary agent hires helper agents
- Escrow + payouts (crypto optional)
- Verification: run logs + artifacts
